# class chat app

Testing: the front end is in the works of being loaded to tester phones via apple's beta testing software. The API can be tested on postman or a similar service

Hierarches - (4/5/2015)

The two super classe we would create for the Android and IOS app are:

class Group {
  contains a title and a discussion
}

The title would be the name of the group, and the discussion would be a list containing the sub groups of the group. (i.e. Class discussion would contain Questions)

The group's subclasses would be Class and Questions. Class would have a title and the discussion would be a list of questions. Questions would have a title as well which is the question being asked, and the discussion would be comments related to that question.
